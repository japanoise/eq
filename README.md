# eq - English Qaballa

This program performs numerological calculations on English words using [James
Lees' system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Qaballa).  Three
dictionaries are provided in plain form and with the values pre-calculated;
these are the Arch Linux word lists lightly sanitized to remove most examples of
genitive declensions (e.g. fool->fool's). The program takes input from stdin and
writes the value of the word, a tab, and the word to stdout.
